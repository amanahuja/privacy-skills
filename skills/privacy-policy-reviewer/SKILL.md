# Skill: privacy-policy-reviewer

Review a privacy policy or terms of service against a structured scorecard,
combining TOSDR's human-curated data with LLM analysis. Designed for
privacy-conscious users who want a fast, honest, sourced read of what they
are actually agreeing to.

---

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke when the user:
- Provides a URL to a privacy policy or terms of service
- Asks you to review, analyze, or summarize a privacy policy
- Provides a service name and wants to know about its privacy practices
- Has received a "policy updated" email and wants to understand what it means

---

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Get the URL or Service Name

Ask the user:

> "Please provide the URL to the privacy policy or terms of service you want
> reviewed, or the name of the service."

If a **URL** is provided:
- Fetch the page content
- Extract the domain (e.g., `surf.social` from `https://about.surf.social/privacy-policy/`)
- Run a TOSDR search using that domain as the query (see TOSDR API below)

If a **service name** is provided:
- Run a TOSDR search using the service name as the query
- Do NOT fetch any URL yet

### Step 2: TOSDR Lookup — Always Confirm with User

Run: `GET https://api.tosdr.org/search/v5?query=<domain or service name>`

**Always present the result(s) to the user and ask for confirmation — even if
only one result is returned, even if no result is found.**

Format the confirmation as:

If one or more results found:
> "I found the following in the TOSDR database. Please confirm which one
> matches the service you want to review, or let me know if none of these
> are correct:
>
> 1. **[Name]** — Rating: [X] — [URL] — tosdr.org/en/service/[id]
> 2. **[Name]** — Rating: [X] — [URL] — tosdr.org/en/service/[id]
> 3. None of these / proceed without TOSDR data"

If no results found:
> "This service is not currently in the TOSDR database. I'll proceed with
> LLM analysis only. If you have a policy URL, please provide it now."

If the user confirms a TOSDR match:
- Fetch full service data: `GET https://api.tosdr.org/service/v3?id=<id>`
- Note: `rating`, `is_comprehensively_reviewed`, `points` array, `documents` array

**Policy source resolution — follow this order strictly, do not skip steps:**

1. The `documents` array in the TOSDR service response contains the exact
   URLs TOSDR used to analyze this service. Extract these URLs first.
   These are the authoritative policy sources for this service.

2. If the user provided a URL in Step 1, add it to the document list if
   it is not already present.

3. For scorecard rows covered by TOSDR approved points: use the TOSDR data
   directly. Do NOT fetch any URL for these rows.

4. For scorecard rows NOT covered by TOSDR points (i.e., gaps): fetch the
   documents[] URLs to find relevant policy language for LLM analysis.

5. If `documents` is empty AND the user provided no URL: ask the user to
   provide the policy URL directly. Do not attempt to guess URLs, do not
   search for alternate paths, do not try common patterns like /privacy
   or /en/privacy.

6. If `is_comprehensively_reviewed` is true: expect most or all rows to
   be covered by TOSDR points. Limit fetching to only what is needed for
   uncovered rows. Do not re-analyze rows that TOSDR has already covered.

### Step 3: Select Review Tier

Ask the user:

> "What level of review do you need?
>
> **Standard** — You're deciding whether to sign up for an everyday service
> (social app, newsletter, SaaS tool). Covers the most important red flags.
>
> **Enhanced** — The service handles real identity, financial information,
> location data, or workplace data. Deeper analysis of what's collected and
> who sees it.
>
> **High Sensitivity** — You're evaluating a service in the context of health,
> reproductive choices, mental health, immigration status, or legal exposure.
> Full analysis including law enforcement access, sensitive data categories,
> and consent withdrawal rights."

Note the selected tier — it governs which cases are checked in the scorecard
and the tone of the narrative.

### Step 4: Jurisdiction

Ask the user:

> "What jurisdiction should I apply when assessing your privacy rights?
>
> - United States (no specific state) [default]
> - A specific US state (e.g., California, Virginia)
> - European Union / GDPR
> - Other country
>
> This affects which rights you have and how the policy's legal language
> applies to you."

Note the jurisdiction for use in the narrative and Key Flags sections.

## TOSDR API Reference

**Base URL:** `https://api.tosdr.org`

### Search
```
GET /search/v5?query=<string>
```
Returns: array of services with `id`, `name`, `rating`, `urls`,
`is_comprehensively_reviewed`, `slug`

### Full Service Data
```
GET /service/v3?id=<id>
```
Returns: `name`, `rating`, `is_comprehensively_reviewed`, `urls`, `documents`,
`points` array

Each point in `points` contains:
- `title` — short human-readable description
- `status` — only use points where `status == "approved"`
- `analysis` — longer explanation
- `case.title` — the case being addressed
- `case.classification` — `blocker`, `bad`, `neutral`, or `good`
- `case.weight` — importance weight (higher = more significant)
- `case.topic_id` — which topic this belongs to (see scorecard below)
- `case.description` — TOSDR's definition of this case

**Only use approved points** (`status == "approved"`). Discard pending,
declined, or disputed points.

---

## Scorecard: 12 Rows

The scorecard always has these 12 rows, in this order. Every row must appear
in the output. If a row cannot be assessed (no relevant policy language found,
no TOSDR points), mark it `[YELLOW]` or `[BAD/NEUTRAL]` and note
"Not addressed in this policy."

- No warrant canary or transparency report — flag as gap at High Sensitivity

---

## Source Labeling Rules

Every scorecard row must be labeled with its source. Use these labels
consistently:

**When data comes from TOSDR approved points:**
```
  ⓣ TOSDR-verified   [BLOCKER] / [BAD] / [NEUTRAL] / [GOOD]
```
Use TOSDR's exact classification terminology: BLOCKER, BAD, NEUTRAL, GOOD.
Include the case title and point ID where useful.

**When data comes from LLM analysis of the policy text:**
```
  ⚙ LLM-generated    [RED] / [YELLOW] / [GREEN]
```
Use Red/Yellow/Green. Always include a direct quote from the policy text.

**When a row is hybrid (some TOSDR points, some LLM gaps):**
```
  ⓣ/⚙ Hybrid        [BAD] / [YELLOW]
```
Label each sub-finding individually within the row.

**In the output header, always state the overall method:**
```
ANALYSIS METHOD: TOSDR-verified (partial, 8/12 rows) + LLM-generated (4/12 rows)
              or TOSDR-verified (comprehensive)
              or LLM-generated only (not in TOSDR)
```

## Narrative Tone by Tier

**Standard**
Calibrate to: "Is this service worth signing up for?"
Acceptable risk framing — some Yellows are normal. Focus on what's
genuinely unusual. Don't over-alarm about boilerplate.

**Enhanced**
Calibrate to: "What does this service actually know about me and who
sees it?"
Be specific about data flows. Name the third parties if listed. Note
whether the policy gives you real control or just the appearance of it.

**High Sensitivity**
Calibrate to: "Could this data be used against me?"
Do not soften. A vague retention policy at this tier is not "something
to watch" — it is a concrete risk. Government request language must be
read in light of the user's stated context. If the service is US-based
and the user's context involves reproductive health or immigration,
explicitly note that US law enforcement can compel disclosure without
a warrant in many circumstances, and that the policy's language does
or does not provide any protection against this.

---

## Jurisdiction Guidance

**United States (no state)**
- Note which state's law governs (from the policy's jurisdiction clause)
- Flag binding arbitration and class action waivers — these limit federal
  court access
- Note if the service honors Global Privacy Control
- At High Sensitivity: flag that the US has no federal comprehensive
  privacy law; user's rights depend heavily on the service's own policy
  commitments

**US State specified**
- California (CCPA/CPRA): user has opt-out of sale/sharing rights, right
  to know, right to delete, right to correct, non-discrimination right.
  Check whether the policy's California section matches these.
- Virginia (CDPA), Colorado (CPA), Connecticut (CTDPA), Texas (TDPSA),
  and others: check if policy acknowledges applicable state law.
- Most other US states: note that comprehensive state privacy law may not
  yet apply; user's rights are limited to what the policy voluntarily offers.
- Wisconsin: no comprehensive state privacy law as of 2026. User's rights
  are limited to what the policy voluntarily offers and any applicable
  sector-specific law (HIPAA for health, GLBA for finance).

**European Union / GDPR**
- Check for: lawful basis for processing, right to erasure, right to
  portability, data protection officer contact, EU representative named,
  adequacy decision or SCCs for data transfers out of EEA
- Flag if policy claims GDPR compliance but does not name a DPA contact
  or EU representative — this is a red flag
- Note if the policy's consent mechanism is genuine opt-in or opt-out-by-
  default

**Other countries**
- Apply best judgment based on the jurisdiction's known privacy framework
- Flag whether the service acknowledges the user's jurisdiction at all

---

## Important Constraints

- **Never fabricate TOSDR data.** If the API returns no results, say so.
  Do not guess at ratings or cite cases that were not returned by the API.
- **Always quote directly from the policy** for any LLM-generated finding.
  Do not paraphrase in a way that changes the meaning.
- **Treat omission as a signal**, not as neutral. If data export is not
  mentioned, note this as a gap, not as "unclear."
- **Do not explain basic privacy concepts** to the user. They are
  privacy-conscious. Be precise and direct.
- **All 12 scorecard rows must appear** in every output, even if some are
  marked "Not addressed in this policy."
- **Confirm TOSDR matches with the user** before using any TOSDR data.
  A wrong match would produce misleading output.
